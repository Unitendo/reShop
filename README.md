## How to compile
Run the following lines of code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unitendo/reShop/
cd reShop
make
```
However, you will not be able to connect to our servers, seeing as that the proper identification is private and inaccessible to the public.

Therefore, the best way to get builds is to wait for us to compile a build and publish it ourselves. Thank you for your patience.
